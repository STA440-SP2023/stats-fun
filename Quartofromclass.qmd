# Part 1 - Intro

## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

| Easy to insert | Table | Col3 |
|----------------|-------|------|
|                |       |      |
|                |       |      |
|                |       |      |

## Running Code

![Image grabbed from Duke website](images/image-850158867.png)

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

# Part 2 - Methods

## Some methods

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).

## Some more methods

```{r}
#| label: fig-scatterplot-cars
#| fig-width: 5
#| fig-asp: 0.618
#| fig-alt: "Scatterplot of cars dataset showing positive correlation"
#| fig-cap: |
#|   Scatterplot
plot(cars)
```

@fig-scatterplot-cars shows a scatterplot of the cars dataset

Now adding a table

```{r}

head(cars) |>
  knitr::kable()
```

Very cool package `gt` for tables in html. For pdf, maybe kableExtra is preferred.

```{r}
#| label: tbl-cars
#| tbl-cap: Pretty gt table
head(cars) |>
  gt::gt()
```

@tbl-cars is the gt version of the head of the cars data set. This is from [@shapiro2017]
