<div id="health-wellness" class="section level3">
<h3>Health &amp; wellness</h3>
<p>If you find that anything is affecting your well-being or academic
success and you find it difficult to complete your work, please let me
and your Academic Dean know as soon as possible. We are happy to work
with you to make sure you succeed in STA 440. You may also find
additional information regarding personal emergencies <a
href="https://trinity.duke.edu/undergraduate/academic-policies/personal-emergencies">here</a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="diversity-inclusiveness-and-accessibility"
class="section level3">
<h3>Diversity, inclusiveness, and accessibility</h3>
<p>The Duke University Community Commitment states: “Because diversity
is essential to fulfilling the university’s mission, Duke is committed
to building an inclusive and diverse university community. Every
student, faculty, and staff member —whatever their race, gender, age,
ethnicity, cultural heritage or nationality; religious or political
beliefs; sexual orientation or gender identity; or socioeconomic,
veteran or ability status—has the right to inclusion, respect, agency
and voice in the Duke community. Further, all members of the University
community have a responsibility to uphold these values and actively
foster full participation in university life.”</p>
<p>It is my goal for our learning environment to facilitate learning and
intellectual development for everyone. To help accomplish this:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you have a name and/or set of pronouns that differ from those
that appear in your official Duke records, please let me know.</li>
<li>We are constantly learning more about diverse perspectives and
identities. If something occurred in class that made you feel
uncomfortable, please talk to me about it.</li>
<li>Duke University is committed to providing equal access to students
with documented disabilities. Students with disabilities may contact the
<a href="https://access.duke.edu/students">Student Disability Access
Office</a> to ensure access to this course and to the program. There you
can engage in a confidential conversation about the process for
requesting reasonable accommodations both in the classroom and in
clinical settings.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="academic-integrity" class="section level3">
<h3>Academic integrity</h3>
<p>Duke University is a community dedicated to scholarship, leadership,
and service and to the principles of honesty, fairness, respect, and
accountability. Citizens of this community commit to reflect upon and
uphold these principles in all academic and nonacademic endeavors, and
to protect and promote a culture of integrity.</p>
<p>Remember the Duke Community Standard that you have agreed to abide
by:</p>
<p>To uphold the Duke Community Standard:</p>
<ul>
<li>I will not lie, cheat, or steal in my academic endeavors;</li>
<li>I will conduct myself honorably in all my endeavors; and</li>
<li>I will act if the Standard is compromised.</li>
</ul>
<p>Cheating or plagiarism on assignments, lying about an illness or
absence and other forms of academic dishonesty are a breach of trust
with classmates and faculty, violate the <a
href="https://trinity.duke.edu/undergraduate/academic-policies/community-standard-student-conduct">Duke
Community Standard</a>, and will not be tolerated. Such incidences will
result in a 0 grade. Additionally, there may be penalties to your final
class grade along with being reported to the Conduct Board.</p>
<p>Please review the <a
href="https://registrar.duke.edu/university-bulletins/duke-community-standard">Duke
Community Standard in Practice</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Occasionally datasets we are privileged to use in class are
confidential and cannot be distributed more broadly. Further
dissemination of such datasets, made available on Sakai, will be
considered a violation of the Duke Community Standard. If you are unsure
whether you can use a dataset for purposes beyond class, please ask
me.</p></li>
<li><p>Much of the work assigned in class is collaborative. The
individual case study must be completed independently. Group case
studies are to be completed by groups and must represent the group’s own
work. For other assignments, while you may talk about strategies for
completing them with other students in the class, the work you submit
must be your own individual work.</p></li>
<li><p>Important note: do not share your course materials with other
students after completion of this course. Doing so will be considered a
violation of the Duke Community Standard.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Referencing code:</strong> The web contains an enormous
volume of code that you may find useful. You are welcome to make use of
any online resources (e.g. StackOverflow), but you must explicitly cite
your sources (for code and otherwise). Any recycled or auto-generated
code that is discovered and is not explicitly cited will be treated as
plagiarism. On the individual case study you may not directly share code
with another student in this class, and on team assignments you may not
directly share code with another team in this class (you are welcome to
discuss the problems together and ask for advice, or make suggestions in
peer review, but you may not send or copy code from another team).</p>
</div>
<div id="course-components" class="section level3">
<h3>Course components</h3>
<div id="class-sessions" class="section level4">
<h4>Class sessions</h4>
<p>Attendance is expected of all students. Students with conflicts or
illness are expected to contact the instructional team and project team
members in order to make up any missed work.</p>
</div>
<div id="teams" class="section level4">
<h4>Teams</h4>
<p>Each group case study will be completed by a team of around 4
students. Groups will change throughout the semester to allow you the
opportunity to work with more students. Groups should adhere to
specified <a href="grouppolicies.html">group policies</a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="group-case-studies" class="section level4">
<h4>Group case studies</h4>
<p>STA 440 involves detailed analysis of case studies using current,
relevant data. Each case study will involve two submissions by the
group, as well as a peer review of another group’s submission. Case
study submissions will involve an initial written report. This first
submission will receive a grade of <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span>. After receipt of comments from the
instructor and classmates, groups will have the opportunity, but are not
required, to submit a revised report for which they can earn up to an
additional 0.5(100-x) points.</p>
<p>Individual contributions to each submission will be assessed. Team
members must provide these assessments in order to receive credit for an
assignment as part of the group’s peer evaluation process. <em>An
individual team member’s grade will be modified if peer evaluations
indicate this is appropriate; modification can result in a grade as low
as 0.</em></p>
<p>Each case study will have a page limit, and under no circumstances
should font sizes less than 11 point be used, with the exception of
labels in figures (and then only if they are still clearly legible to
readers of all ages).</p>
</div>
<div id="peer-review" class="section level4">
<h4>Peer review</h4>
<p>Students will be asked to provide feedback and comments on the case
studies presented by other groups throughout the course. This feedback
will be provided to the groups and will also be assessed as part of the
course. The ability to provide thoughtful, constructive feedback is
critical in the workplace and a valued skill. Peer reviewers will be
asked to check reproducibility. Reviewers of a case will have the
opportunity to discuss the case with other reviewers, but each
individual’s reviews will be assessed individually.</p>
<p><img src="images/flowchart.png" style="width:10in" /></p>
</div>
<div id="individual-project" class="section level4">
<h4>Individual project</h4>
<p>Each student will complete an individual project as part of the
course. The individual project should use data that have not previously
been used by the student in a project, and the analysis should be
entirely the student’s own work. Any external resources used should be
clearly documented. The student may use self-identified data or a
resource provided by the instructor.</p>
<p>The individual project involves multiple due dates throughout the
semester, to ensure students devote the required time and energy to
their effort. These interim submissions will be reviewed by the
instructional team and at times by peers, with the goal of maximizing
the quality of the final report.</p>
</div>
<div id="lab-and-class-activities" class="section level4">
<h4>Lab and class activities</h4>
<p>A number of smaller scale assessments will be administered, with the
goal of honing skills in a variety of areas, including scientific
communication, model evaluation, use and conduct of simulation studies,
research ethics, and interpretation of results. Additional topics will
be added based on the course trajectory and student needs. These
activities will provide a way to obtain individual feedback on important
statistical science skills.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="grading" class="section level3">
<h3>Grading</h3>
<p>Your final grade will be comprised of the following.</p>
<table>
<colgroup>
<col width="35%" />
<col width="64%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Component</th>
<th align="right">% of Grade</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Individual Assignments (including peer reviews)</td>
<td align="right">10%</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Group case study 1</td>
<td align="right">15%</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Group case study 2</td>
<td align="right">20%</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">

<td align="right">20%</td>

<tr class="odd">

<td align="right">15%</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Individual project final report (part III) and oral
presentation</td>
<td align="right">15%</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Each report will be graded based on the initial submission, with the
ability to earn additional points based on the revised report for the
individual project and case studies.</p>
<p>Cumulative numerical averages of 90 - 100 are guaranteed at least an
A-, 80 - 89 at least a B-, 70 - 79 at least a C-, and 60 - 69 at least a
D-; however, the exact ranges for letter grades will be determined at
the end of the semester. The grade ranges may need to be shifted to the
left, and when appropriate, students will be given guidance on
interpreting grades when assignments are returned. The more evidence
there is that the class is performing at the highest level, the higher
the grade distribution will be.</p>
</div>
<div id="late-missed-work" class="section level3">
<h3>Late / missed work</h3>
<p>If work is turned in within 24 hours after the due date/time, then
there is a 20% penalty. However, due to the fast-paced nature of this
course, absolutely no late work will be accepted beyond this period
without a Dean’s excuse.</p>
</div>
<div id="regrade-requests" class="section level3">
<h3>Regrade requests</h3>
<p>Regrade requests must be made within two days of when a report is
returned. These will be honored if points were tallied incorrectly, or
if you feel part of your report is correct, but it was marked wrong
(these things do happen!). No regrade will be made to alter the number
of points deducted for an issue. When a regrade request is evaluated, if
new errors are identified, additional points may be deducted from the
grade.</p>
